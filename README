An LRU Cache implementation with methods:

BOUND    :  Set the upper bound. If the cache size is currently greater than this number, then extra entries must be removed following the LRU policy

SET   :  Set the value of this key

GET   :  Get the value of this key and prints to stdout.

PEEK   :  Gets the value of the key but does not mark it as being used. Prints the value to standard out.

DUMP  :  Prints the current state of the cache as a list of key/value pairs in alphabetical order by key.
